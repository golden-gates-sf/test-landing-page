          Having been married for 17 years, divorced, and successfully dated
          again in today’s complex social environment, and now happily married,
          Marni understands what it feels like to be lonely and sick of wasting
          time going on dates and having relationships with unavailable men that
          go nowhere. <br><br> Through her own journey to find love, Marni discovered that
          creating a process to shorten the journey for other women suffering from
          the inability to create emotionally safe and fulfilling life
          relationships was truly the mission of her soul and purpose.
